1. In your Vercel project dashboard, click "Settings" tab
2. Click "Domains" in the left sidebar
3. Type `freshpro.co.ke` in the domain field

### 3.2 Configure DNS in NameCheap

2. Log into your NameCheap account
3. Go to "Domain List" and find `freshpro.co.ke`
4. Click "Manage" next to your domain

### 3.3 Add DNS Records
You need to add these records exactly as shown:

**Record 1:**
- Type: `A Record`
- Host: `@`
- Value: `76.76.19.19`
- TTL: `Automatic`

**Record 2:**
- Type: `CNAME Record`

2. Select the record type from dropdown
3. Enter the Host and Value exactly as shown above
4. Click the checkmark to save
5. Repeat for the second record

### 3.4 Remove Default Records (Important!)
1. Look for any existing A Records pointing to parking pages
2. Delete any A Records with values like `192.254.187.96` or similar
3. Keep only the DNS records you just added

## Step 4: Wait and Verify

### 4.1 DNS Propagation
- DNS changes take 5 minutes to 24 hours to work worldwide
- Usually works within 30 minutes
- You can check progress at [whatsmydns.net](https://whatsmydns.net)

### 4.2 SSL Certificate
- Vercel automatically creates a free SSL certificate
- Your site will be accessible via `https://freshpro.co.ke`
- This may take up to 24 hours to fully activate

## Step 5: Test Your Website

1. Wait at least 30 minutes after adding DNS records
2. Try visiting `https://freshpro.co.ke` in your browser
3. Try `https://www.freshpro.co.ke` as well
4. Both should show your Fresh Pro website

## Troubleshooting

### Website Not Loading?
- Wait longer (DNS can take up to 24 hours)
- Check DNS records are entered correctly in NameCheap
- Make sure you deleted any old/default DNS records

### "SSL Error" or "Not Secure"?
- Wait 24 hours for SSL certificate to activate
- Try accessing with `http://` instead of `https://` temporarily

### Still Having Issues?
- Contact Vercel support (they have excellent free support)
- Contact NameCheap support for DNS-related issues
- Double-check all DNS records are exactly as specified
